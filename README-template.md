## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
-Google font files

### What I learned

What I learned from all this is that good font link's font weight does not always works, which is pretty much what I had a lot of problem with, figuring out why it is not working and I could assume that it is just the browser incompatibility. I solve this problem by have to download the needed files and exported it into sunnyside-landing page, I type the code @font-face and used the root to make it easier to work with because there is only two types of font.
Example: 

@font-face {
    font-family: francis;
    src: url(Fraunces/Fraunces-VariableFont_SOFT\,WONK\,opsz\,wght.ttf); this lets me add any weight
}

@font-face {
    font-family: barlmow;
    src: url(Barlow/Barlow-SemiBold.ttf); fixed weight to semibold
}

I used grid a lot on this website which definitely help to arrange to where each block needs to be and how they are placed.

### Continued development

I'll continue to learn more on javascript so that there will be more interactive layouts.
